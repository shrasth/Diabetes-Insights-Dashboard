# 🩺 Diabetes Insights Dashboard — Power BI | DAX | SQL | Data Modeling

## 📘 Overview
This project explores diabetes prevalence and associated health risk factors using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset, containing over 250,000 survey records and 21 health variables.

The goal was to design an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights on how demographics, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions impact diabetes risk.  
It provides data-driven insights to support public health analytics and preventive health strategies.

## 📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and modeled the BRFSS dataset using Power Query and SQL 
- Built data relationships and DAX measures to calculate metrics:
  - Diabetes %
  - Average BMI
  - High BP / High Cholesterol %
  - Physical Activity %
- Designed a 3-page Power BI dashboard for rich exploration:
  1. Overview: Key diabetes indicators and demographic breakdown  
  2. Drivers of Diabetes: Lifestyle, BMI, and chronic condition correlations  
  3. Health Insights: Healthcare access, physical activity, and general health patterns
- Implemented interactive slicers, navigation buttons, and KPI cards for usability  
- Applied a dark, modern theme for consistent design and easy readability

## 🧠 Insights Derived
- Adults aged 45–65 exhibit the highest diabetes prevalence  
- Strong correlation observed between High BP, Obesity, and Smoking with diabetes risk  
- Lower income and education levels were linked to higher diabetes rates  
- Physical inactivity significantly increased the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis
